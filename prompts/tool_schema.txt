Available Tools:
1. take_picture(plant_name: str) - Take a picture of a plant and get its status
   Returns: JSON with:
   - hydration_status: Hydration indicator (0.0 = good, positive = overhydrated, negative = underhydrated)
     * Scale: -1.0 to +1.0, where 0.0 is optimal
     * Positive values (0.0 to 1.0): overhydrated (higher = worse)
     * Negative values (-1.0 to 0.0): underhydrated (more negative = worse)
   - water_frequency_status: Watering frequency indicator (0.0 = good, positive = too frequent, negative = too infrequent)
     * 0.0 = optimal frequency
     * Positive values: watering too frequently (higher = more frequent than ideal)
     * Negative values: watering too infrequently (more negative = less frequent than ideal)
   - species_instructions: Expected care instructions for the species
   - last_watering: Timestamp of last watering (if any)
   - watering_count: Total number of times plant has been watered
   
2. water(plant_name: str, water_quantity: float) - Water a plant with specified water_quantity (in cups)
   Returns: Success status and message
   
3. add_task(task_description: str, priority: float, minutes: float) - Schedule a task
   Returns: Scheduled time and confirmation
   
4. add_memory(plant_name: str, memory: str) - Add a memory about a plant
   Returns: Confirmation and total memory count

Tool Usage Format:
- Always respond with a JSON object containing "reasoning" and "tool_calls" fields
- "reasoning" is a string explaining what you observed and why you're taking these actions
- "tool_calls" is an ARRAY of tool call objects (even if just one tool)
- Each tool call has "tool" and "args" fields (no reasoning in individual tool calls)
- Always provide an array for tool_calls, even for a single tool

Example format:
{
  "reasoning": "Observed Cactus1 has hydration_status of -0.5 (underhydrated). Watering with 1 cup to bring hydration level back to optimal range.",
  "tool_calls": [
    {"tool": "water", "args": {"plant_name": "Cactus1", "water_quantity": 1.0}}
  ]
}

Example with multiple tools:
{
  "reasoning": "Plant needs watering and I should record this observation.",
  "tool_calls": [
    {"tool": "water", "args": {"plant_name": "Cactus1", "water_quantity": 1.0}},
    {"tool": "add_memory", "args": {"plant_name": "Cactus1", "memory": "Watered plant due to underhydration"}}
  ]
}
